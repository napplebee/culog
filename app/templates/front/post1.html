        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter (170 g)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar, preferably brown (130 g)</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (260 g)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips (170 g) or even 2 cups for REAL chocolate lovers :)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>
            Tools:
        </strong>
        <p>For cookies with a chewier texture, use a wooden spoon to mix the dough.<br />
        For cookies with cake-like texture, use a mixer that will incorporate more air into the dough.
        </p>
        <strong>Process:</strong>
        <br/>
            Preparation:
        <br/>
        <ul class="preparation">
            <li>preheat the oven to 160° С (325° F),</li>
            <li>if you prefer cookies with a chewier texture, melt the butter, and  then cool to room temperature, otherwise, bring the butter to room temperature.</li>
        </ul>

            Wet ingredients:
        <br/>
        <ul class="preparation">
            <li>in a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar  (with a mixer, use high speed),</li>
            <li>add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract,</li>
            <li>beat until smooth.</li>
        </ul>


    Dry ingredients:
    <br/>
    <ul class="preparation">
        <li>sift the flour and baking powder together,</li>
        <li>stir in the salt.</li>
    </ul>

    Mixing the dough:
    <br/>
    <ul class="preparation">
        <li>mix the dry ingredients into the bowl,</li>
<li>stir until everything is incorporated (with a mixer, use low speed),</li>
<li>add the chocolate chips.</li>

    </ul>

    Baking and serving:
    <br/>
    <ul class="preparation">
<li>line a baking tray with parchment paper or spray with non-stick spray,</li>
<li>using a large spoon, form equal size rounds of dough (leave enough space between each cookie as they will spread out a bit as they bake),</li>
<li>(optional) refrigerate for 15 minutes before baking,</li>
<li>bake the cookies until the edges turn a light golden color (about 15 minutes),</li>
<li>once done, cool for a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack,</li>
<li>allow to cool completely before serving.</li>

    </ul>
